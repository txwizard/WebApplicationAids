    File Name:          AssemblyInfo.cs

    Synopsis:           This AssemblyInfo file belongs to Visual Studio project
                        TestStand, which is part of solution WebApplicationAids.

    Remarks:            I don't usually include revision histories in my
                        AssemblyInfo files. This is an exception, because the
                        version update is to account for a change that affects
                        only the related C Sharp project file. Hence, I won't
                        routinely update this history.
