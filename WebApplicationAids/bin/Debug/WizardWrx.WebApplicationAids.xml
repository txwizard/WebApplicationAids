            This static (Shared in Visual Basic) class exposes static (Shared in
            Visual Basic) methods that enable any assembly, be it EXE or or DLL, to
            query web.config files for values.

            <summary>
            Get the connection string identified by name by string
            <paramref name="pstrConnectionStringName"/> from the official
            connectionStrings section of the web.config file specified by the
            relative or absolute file named in string
            <paramref name="pstrAbsoluteConfigFileName"/>.
            </summary>
            <param name="pstrAbsoluteConfigFileName">
            This string must be either an absolute (fully qualified) file name
            or a name that is valid relative to the current working directory.
            </param>
            <param name="pstrConnectionStringName">
            This string must contain the "name" property of a node in the
            connectionStrings section of a well-formed web.config file.
            </param>

            <para>
            If it succeeds, the return value is a ConnectionStringSettings
            object that has valid name and connectionString properties.
            Otherwise, the return value is NULL.
            </para>
            <para>
            Its providerName property may have a value, or it may be null.
            </para>
            <para>
            Regardless, the returned ConnectionStringSettings object can be
            treated as if it had been read from a web.config file in the usual
            way.
            </para>
            </returns>
            <remarks>
            This method works by treating the web.config file as a standard XML
            document.
